# CTA IP Lookup

## Running Locally
Pull down this repo and run the following (Node 18+ recommended):
```Bash
npm install
# For fast dev view:
npm run dev
# For production preview:
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- I decided to focus on a slim front-end app, since nothing really required a back-end.
- I also made the call to focus on tidying up the look and feel, rather than building out unit tests.
